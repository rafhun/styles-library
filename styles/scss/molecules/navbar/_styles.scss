# Navbar Styles

This is the main navigation navbar. It features a dropdown for level 2 items and will move off canvas for small screens. The off canvas menu will be built as a seperate component below. It remains to be seen, whether both menus can be put into one or whether there will have to be two different menus on the page.

See the config page for the code example.

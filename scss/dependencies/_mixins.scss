# Mixins

Global mixins that are to be used on a variety of components/molecules are set up in this file. Keep component/molecule specific mixins in their respective files only global stuff should be added here.

The following mixins have been prepared for you:
* Auto Separator Mixin
* Micro Clearfix by Nicolas Gallagher
* Text Ellipsis Mixin

## Auto Separator
`@mixin separator($margins: rem-calc(6), $separator-color: inherit, $separator: '|', $font-size: inherit) {}`

This mixin automatically puts a separator between list items (or basically any items the mixin is applied to) by adding content to the `::after` pseudoelement and positioning it with margins and paddings.

@TODO: replace dependency on inline-block display method, since a hack is needed to fix alignment. Is it possible and time to use a flexbox approach?

## Micro Clearfix by Nicolas Gallagher
`@mixin clearfix`

Not much has to be explained about this mixin. Used to clear floats as suggested by Nicolas Gallagher.

## Text Ellipsis
`@mixin text-ellipsis`

Applies all the styles needed to get a CSS ellipsis if the text overflows its container. Can only be used on single lines of text (therefore we set the white-space to nowrap). Mostly used for teasers and similar.
